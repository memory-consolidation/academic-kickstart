    Inhibition within HVC (a cortical premotor nucleus) regulates call timing in zebra finches. a Call responses (blue bars) to call playbacks (gray) during bilateral infusion of saline in HVC (control). b Accelerated call responses (orange bars) during infusion of 0.01 mM gabazine. c Response probability distributions for control (blue) and gabazine (orange) conditions in (a, b).
     These results support a working model in which premotor inhibition regulates context-dependent timing of vocalizations and enables the precise interleaving of vocal signals during turn-taking.
