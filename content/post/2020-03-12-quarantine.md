What does a researcher when he is asked to stay home, unable to collect new data? I will collect here some thought and experience gathered over the years. 

# Reading papers

Let's start with the obvious: catch up with the literature can be done anywhere. If you need to access paywalled papers, there is different ways:
- Get a VPN access to your university network (https://www.cms.hu-berlin.de/de/dl/netze/vpn/openvpn)
- use unpaywall on firefox to get a link to a legal copy of the article (if one exists)
- send a email/slack message to the authors or someone who knows has access
- use a pirate website to get a copy illegally (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub)

Do not forget to use a reference manager to gather article metadata at download, my favourite open source one is zotero: https://www.zotero.org (This will greatly facilitate your work when using these paper as reference in a future paper). You can add notes and tags into your reference manager directly.

Since you have quite some time free, you may try to make your remarks about the paper public. It can be a blogpost to share with your colleagues, or a more formal post-publication peer review (you can use https://www.scienceopen.com for that), or a comment or email if the article is still in a preprint stage. 

# Analysing your data

If you can not collect new data, you can still work on your data analysis. For this you will need your data (at least some of it). You can either get it on a external hard disk, or online on GIN http://www.g-node.org. If you go for the latter solution, you may use a template repository. Click `+ > Import repository` and use https://gin.g-node.org/larkumlab/Main_template as the clone address. Upload then data via the browser (drag and dropfolders).

You may use the time to investigate new ways to analyse your data, learning a programming language like R and python, and/or testing new algorithms and analysis.

# Prepare analysis without data

You may even prepare your data analysis
