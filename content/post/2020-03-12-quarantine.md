What does a researcher when he is asked to stay home, unable to collect new data? I will collect here some thought and experience gathered over the years. 

This is a work in progress, please give comments and feedback here https://github.com/smartfigures-dar/feedback_repo/issues/new?assignees=jcolomb&labels=website&template=website-issue.md&title=

# A desk at home!

## Prepare your working environment

If you can, get a room, desk, chair and storage place dedicated to work. The longer the time spent in home office, the more important it become to get a nice, organised work place in your home. Invest some time to create that environment.

## Keep social contacts

Use your phone and video calls to keep yourself in social contact with other lab members and friends. emails do not count.

# Possible tasks and how to prepare them

## Socializing

Reach out to people you want to work with on specific project, or colleagues you have not met for some time, ask for updates, give yours. Your social network is part of your academic success, give some of your time everyday to strengthen these bonds.

## Reading papers

Let's start with the obvious: catch up with the literature can be done anywhere. If you need to access pay-walled papers, there is different ways:
- Get a VPN access to your university network (https://www.cms.hu-berlin.de/de/dl/netze/vpn/openvpn)
- use unpaywall on firefox to get a link to a legal copy of the article (if one exists)
- send a email/slack message to the authors or someone who knows has access
- use a pirate website to get a copy illegally (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub)

Do not forget to use a reference manager to gather article metadata at download, my favorite open source one is zotero: https://www.zotero.org (This will greatly facilitate your work when using these paper as reference in a future paper). You can add notes and tags into your reference manager directly.

Since you have quite some time free, you may try to make your remarks about the paper public. It can be a blog-post to share with your colleagues, or a more formal post-publication peer review (you can use https://www.scienceopen.com for that), or a comment or email if the article is still in a preprint stage. 
## Writing (and documenting experiments)

You can start writing your next paper, even if you do not have much results yet. You can use the time to collect information you will need for the material and method section, write down your protocols, be sure to have all information needed to describe your material and animals. The Arrive checklist can help you: https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/Guidelines/NC3Rs%20ARRIVE%20Guidelines%20Checklist%20%28fillable%29.pdf

For genetic information, gather or request a MGI number for your animal strain: http://www.informatics.jax.org/home/strain (if it was already published, sometimes it is easier to search for the publication there to find the strain).

For material (plasmid, chemicals,..), check whether there is a RRID number (https://scicrunch.org/resources), or look for another way to identify the material.


## Analyzing (and organizing) your data

If you can not collect new data, you can still work on your data analysis. For this you will need your data (at least some of it). You can either get it on a external hard disk, or online on GIN http://www.g-node.org. If you go for the latter solution, you may use a template repository. Click `+ > Import repository` and use https://gin.g-node.org/larkumlab/Main_template as the clone address. Upload then data via the browser (drag and drop folders). 

You may use the time to investigate new ways to analyse your data, learning a programming language like R and python, and/or testing new algorithms and analysis. It might help to write readme files to describe the data-sets, maybe reorganize the files to facilitate the analysis (as well as adding metadata to  make the data re-usable in different contexts).

**Please reach out to the data curator if you need help to organise your data !**

## Computational project

If you do not have one, you might find a side project not involving animal experiments. Maybe you can access existing data (from your past experiments, from a lab mate or from an open data repository) and work on new ways to analyse it ?

 
>In 2011, my test device broke and I could not do any experiments for 8 months. I had to start a new project, and spent a lot of time working on the analysis of trajectories that had been started in the lab. It ended up being a great learning experience (I am now a decent R programmer), and got me 3 publications, two as first author.



# Learn new skills

Last but not least, you can spend time to learn new skills. There are a lot of free offers around, let it be programming, open source software, time management, project management, group moderation, open science topics, scientific writing,...
