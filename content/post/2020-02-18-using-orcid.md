This blog post will explain different steps to fill your orcid profile, but let's start by giving an introduction about why I would like to use orcid as a data source for personal pages of the SFB1315.

## Why you should have an orcid profile

Every researcher is asked to fill forms again and again. To create personal pages for this website, we need some information from you, information we might need for the SmartFigure, information you could use in different application. Updating information would need both a new form, and manual work.But instead of using another form, we will use orcid as a source of (open) data. This will allow us to use that information for the website (updating the website with new data from orcid), for the smartfigure gallery, and maybe other analyses. 

There are many other reasons libraries and other institutions are advicing for getting an orcid profile see https://vimeo.com/237730655,
and https://blogs.hu-berlin.de/wir_bewegen_buecher/2017/10/27/orcid/. In particular, orcid information can be pushed to wikidata, and be used for wikidata scholia profile (see mine here: https://tools.wmflabs.org/scholia/author/Q47502306).


## Step 1: Register in 35 seconds

Go to https://orcid.org, click the register/sign-in button. If you do not have an account, register one.

```
Putative final step: Delegate in one minute

Make someone responsible for adding information in your orcid profile: 
- Sign into your orcid page https://orcid.org/my-orcid
- In the upper-right corner, click your name, and choose `account settings` in the menu
- use the `trusted individual` box to give rights to update your profile to somebody you trust. You can revoke this right anytime.

```

## Step 2: add SFB1315 funding information

- add the SFB1315 in the funding

- add the SFB1315 in the funding (see video: https://figshare.com/articles/add_allinfo_small_mov/11848407)

Optional information imported in the website:
- add a biography text
- add a link to a picture of you, name it “picture"
- add a link to your page in the lab, be sure to mention “lab” in its name and put it preferably in the first position.
- add links you would like to see on your personal page on the website like twitter, github or gitlab pages. 
- add a visible main email address


Optional information not (yet) imported in the website:

- add all your publication
- add all your funding
- add your affiliations (present and past, in the Employment field)
- add education and qualifications
- add all your other research outputs (datasets, software,...) anything with a doi counts

Optional cool stuff you can do with your orcid
- get a scienceopen profile
- check your impact story badges
- create a wikidata scholia page (including co-author graphical representation)
